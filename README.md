## Project Overview
In this project, we will predict loan application approval. we will first import the dataset which was taken from kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset  and clean it. split the dataset into training and testing set, build machine learning models on the dataset and evaluate the performance of these models. And finally, we build a simple web app and deploy the model to the web app using flask framework.

## Project Steps
- Download Dataset
- Clean data and prepare it for machine learning implementation
- Create machine learning model and estimate accuracy
- Deploy the model on a web app


## Code
You can find the code for this project named as ReadyModel.ipynb
